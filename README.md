# About
In this project, I will set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. Then, we can observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. A custom PowerShell script will be used to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.
